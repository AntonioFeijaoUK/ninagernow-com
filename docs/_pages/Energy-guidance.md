Sometimes it is inspiration you need, so call in your mentor from within, do sommething that is not tied to obligations. Breathe deeply and let lifeforze in. Breathing in and out make you relax, and is an indicator to your body and psychological mind, that you are open to receive. You can let go and let energy in.

Balance your body and mind is nessesary for the energy to flow through you. Let your body know it is ok to be and to receive. Receiving your souls guidance lead to inspiration and joy.
