**A relationship is more of an assignment than a choice. We can walk away from the assignment, but we can not walk away from the lessons it presents. We stay with a relationship until a lesson is learned, or we simply learn it another way.**
 
 -Marianne Williamson

**Hvis jeg elsker mig selv, vil jeg udtrykke den kærlighed i mit forhold til andre. At være ren i sin energi, betyder at, at man bruger sin energi i retning af sandhed og kærlighed.**
 
 -Don Miguel Ruiz 


Everything is made of energy and your are connectet to the Universe, the energy field through your consciousness. Stepping into the higher realm of consciousness leads to a miraculous transformation. Conciousness do not need healing, you can instantly tap in, turn on the higher realm of energy, which then shift your energy to a much higher level. You  actually can feel it in a blink of an eye. Your body and your mood feels lighter, everything feels possible.

That is exactly the right place to live your life from. It all starts with awareness and choosing self-love.

You are the number one important person in your life. Caring for yourself, filling your cup with selflove and making sure your needs are met opens the floodgate to receive joy and happiness. We are the one who opens the floodgate, one else can do this for us. It is up to us to decide, when we need rest and when we are in the flow. It is our feelings that are the indicator.

Sometimes it is inspiration you need, so call in your mentor from within, do sommething that is not tied to obligations. Breathe deeply and let lifeforze in. Breathing in and out make you relax, and is an indicator to your body and psychological mind, that you are open to receive. You can let go and let energy in.

Balance your body and mind is nessesary for the energy to flow through you. Let your body know it is ok to be and to receive. Receiving your souls guidance lead to inspiration and joy. Your natural state of being is infinite harmony, it is natural. Balanced energy smoothly moving between inward and outward expressions of life, the ying and yang, the masculine and feminine is natural. We are all expressions of both forms of energy, and it is nessesary for the fulfillment of life.

It is not a selfish thing to put yourself first, it is ideal. Then you have more to give to others. Taking care of your health, your mind and soul makes you more kind, because you are an expression of kindness towards yourself. Your balance reflects the love you give to your self.

You are made of energy, your energy body surrounds your fysical body which allow the energy to flow. Remember the fysical body is created from the energy arround body. Beyond that we have the mental and emotinal body. Emotional traumas creates limiting beliefs. Beliefs creates constrictions (shadows). Beliefs and emotional pain creates blockages in the enrgy body, which then creates blockages in your fysical body, what makes it difficult for the energy to flow.

When your energy body is balanced and the energy flows, it allows stuck emotions to go, which allow more balance in the fysical body. When you clear mental and emotional pain it clears your energetic part. Healing in one part affects healing in the others, which then clear the way for you to return to the infinite being you are.
