# Love and Light

**Love and Light**, we all are it and have it within!

The connection to our great inner being, to our true and higher self is living a purposeful life.
And isn't what we are seeking true life's journey?

In whatever area you seeek transformation - in the area of self-love, health, romantic love, carriere, wealth and partnership - it all comes back to where you are centered in and where you gain power from. 

We all are a being of love & light and it took bravery to come back to the earth in fysiocal form to expand our soul's growth into a higher expressing of love & light. Your soul's purpose is for you to see, feel, know and express the love you are.

## 3 ways of connections to your love & power##

Everything happens for a reason, says Matt Kahn and everything is here to serve you in the highest way.
That can sometimes challenge in situations of failure and feeling stuck!

The most beautiful way failure was taught, was from a parent who asked his children: 'What failure did you experince Today'?
This question taught the children that they could manage disapointment and feeling they were lovable all though!

It is not about being perfect or manage life from the safe and  predicable way. It can easaly lead to living a limited and small life - like 'living in a box'.

It is more about recilience and our ability to raise in set-backs and unpredicable situations. Whatever the case, the importance is to feel the connections in three ways in life.

## 1: Being connected to your self and your deepest desires for your life ignites your power##

##2: Being connected to a higher power, the Universe, the source, God - that is innerconnected to you##

## 3: Being connected to the field of relatedness with others##
